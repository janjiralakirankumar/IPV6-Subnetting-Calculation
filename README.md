### 1. **What is an IP Address?**

An **IP (Internet Protocol) Address** is a unique identifier assigned to devices on a network. It serves two main functions:
- **Identification**: Each device on a network needs a unique identifier to communicate.
- **Location Addressing**: IP addresses provide a way to locate devices on a network for data exchange.

#### **Examples of IP Addresses**:
- **IPv4**: `192.168.1.1`
- **IPv6**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

---

### 2. **Types of IP Addresses**

#### **1. Public IP Address**:
- Used to identify devices on the internet, provided by your ISP.
- **Example**: `203.0.113.1` (IPv4), `2001:db8:abcd:0012::1` (IPv6)

#### **2. Private IP Address**:
- Used within local networks (home or office), not routable on the internet.
- **Example**: `192.168.1.1` (IPv4), `fd00::1` (IPv6)

#### **3. Static IP Address**:
- Manually assigned, does not change over time.
- **Example**: `203.0.113.10` (IPv4), `2001:db8:abcd::1` (IPv6)

#### **4. Dynamic IP Address**:
- Automatically assigned, typically by a DHCP server, and may change.
- **Example**: `192.168.1.105` (IPv4), `2001:db8::5678` (IPv6)

---

### 3. **Versions of IP Address**

#### **1. IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)**:
- **Length**: 32-bit, offering ~4.3 billion addresses.
- **Format**: Dotted decimal.
- **Example**: `192.168.1.1`

#### **2. IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6)**:
- **Length**: 128-bit, offering 340 undecillion addresses.
- **Format**: Hexadecimal.
- **Example**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

---

### 4. **Static vs Dynamic IP: Use Cases**

#### **Static IP Address**:
- **Use Cases**: Hosting servers, email services, VPNs.
- **Example**: A web server with a static IP of `203.0.113.10` (IPv4) or `2001:db8:abcd::1234` (IPv6).

#### **Dynamic IP Address**:
- **Use Cases**: Home users, mobile devices.
- **Example**: A router dynamically assigns `192.168.1.100` (IPv4) to a device, or an ISP assigns `2001:db8::abcd` (IPv6).

Here’s a comprehensive explanation of calculating **IPv4 addresses**, including detailed instructions on converting between binary and decimal, as well as subnetting calculations through bit borrowing.

---

## **IPv4 Address Calculation**

### **1. Understanding IPv4 Address Structure**

An **IPv4 address** is a 32-bit number typically represented in **dotted decimal** format, consisting of four **octets**. Each octet can range from 0 to 255.

**Example**: `192.168.1.1`

- **In Binary**:  
  - 192 → `11000000`  
  - 168 → `10101000`  
  - 1   → `00000001`  
  - 1   → `00000001`  

So, `192.168.1.1` in binary is:  
`11000000.10101000.00000001.00000001`

### **2. Binary to Decimal Conversion**

**To convert a binary number to decimal**, follow these steps:

1. Write down the binary number.
2. Assign powers of 2 from right to left, starting at 0.
3. Multiply each bit by its corresponding power of 2.
4. Sum the results.

**Example**: Convert `11000000` to decimal.

- Break down:
  - \( 1 \times 2^7 = 128 \)
  - \( 1 \times 2^6 = 64 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^5 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^4 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^3 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^2 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^1 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^0 = 0 \)

**Total**: \( 128 + 64 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 192 \)

### **3. Decimal to Binary Conversion**

**To convert a decimal number to binary**, you can use the following method:

1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Write down the remainder (0 or 1).
3. Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until it reaches 0.
4. The binary number is read from bottom to top.

**Example**: Convert `192` to binary.

1. \( 192 \div 2 = 96 \) remainder `0`
2. \( 96 \div 2 = 48 \) remainder `0`
3. \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \) remainder `0`
4. \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \) remainder `0`
5. \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \) remainder `0`
6. \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \) remainder `0`
7. \( 3 \div 2 = 1 \) remainder `1`
8. \( 1 \div 2 = 0 \) remainder `1`

**Binary Representation**: Reading from bottom to top gives `11000000`.

---

## **4. Subnetting in IPv4**

### **Understanding Subnetting**

**Subnetting** is a technique used to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets). This allows for better management of IP addresses and improves network performance.

### **Subnet Mask**

A **subnet mask** defines the network and host portions of an IP address. It is also a 32-bit number, typically written in the same dotted decimal format.

**Example**: The subnet mask `255.255.255.0` is equivalent to `/24` CIDR notation, meaning that the first 24 bits are used for the network.

### **Calculating Subnets by Borrowing Bits**

1. **Identify Network and Host Portions**:
   - Use the subnet mask to identify how many bits are allocated for the network and how many for the hosts.

2. **Borrow Bits**:
   - To create additional subnets, you can borrow bits from the host portion. Each borrowed bit doubles the number of available subnets but halves the number of usable IP addresses per subnet.

#### **Example: Borrowing Bits for Subnetting**

**Scenario**: Start with the IP address `192.168.1.0/24` (subnet mask `255.255.255.0`).

- **Current Configuration**: 
  - Network bits: 24 (first three octets)
  - Host bits: 8 (last octet)
  
- **Borrow 2 Bits**:  
  This will create \(2^2 = 4\) subnets.

- **New Subnet Mask**:  
  - The new subnet mask will be `/26` (24 + 2 = 26).
  - In decimal, the subnet mask becomes `255.255.255.192` (binary: `11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000`).

### **Calculating First, Last, and Usable IP Ranges**

1. **Determine the Subnet Size**:
   - A `/26` subnet provides \(2^{(32 - 26)} = 2^6 = 64\) addresses per subnet.

2. **First and Last IP Addresses**:
   - The **first IP** (network address) is `192.168.1.0`.
   - The **last IP** (broadcast address) is `192.168.1.63`.

3. **Usable IP Range**:
   - The usable IP addresses are all addresses between the first and last IP, excluding these two.
   - **Usable IPs**: `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.1.62`.

### **Example Subnets for `/26`**:

1. **Subnet 1**: 
   - **Network**: `192.168.1.0/26`  
   - **First IP**: `192.168.1.1`  
   - **Last IP**: `192.168.1.62`  
   - **Broadcast**: `192.168.1.63`  

2. **Subnet 2**: 
   - **Network**: `192.168.1.64/26`  
   - **First IP**: `192.168.1.65`  
   - **Last IP**: `192.168.1.126`  
   - **Broadcast**: `192.168.1.127`  

3. **Subnet 3**: 
   - **Network**: `192.168.1.128/26`  
   - **First IP**: `192.168.1.129`  
   - **Last IP**: `192.168.1.190`  
   - **Broadcast**: `192.168.1.191`  

4. **Subnet 4**: 
   - **Network**: `192.168.1.192/26`  
   - **First IP**: `192.168.1.193`  
   - **Last IP**: `192.168.1.254`  
   - **Broadcast**: `192.168.1.255`  

---

### **5. Summary of Subnetting Process**

- **Identify** the initial network configuration (IP address and subnet mask).
- **Determine** how many subnets you need and borrow the necessary bits from the host portion.
- **Calculate** the new subnet mask and the number of hosts per subnet.
- **Calculate** the first and last usable IP addresses, along with the broadcast address for each subnet.

Here's a detailed guide on how to calculate **IPv6 addresses**, including the conversion between binary and decimal, as well as subnetting calculations through bit borrowing.

---

## **IPv6 Address Calculation**

### **1. Understanding IPv6 Address Structure**

An **IPv6 address** is a 128-bit number, typically represented in **hexadecimal** format and divided into eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.

**Example**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`

### **2. Converting IPv6 to Binary**

To convert each group of an IPv6 address from hexadecimal to binary:

1. **Identify Each Hexadecimal Digit**:
   - Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 4 bits.
  
2. **Convert Hexadecimal to Binary**:
   - Use a lookup table to convert hexadecimal digits to their binary equivalent.

#### **Hexadecimal to Binary Conversion Table**

  - 8 → `1000`  
  - 5 → `0101`  
  - a → `1010`  
  - 3 → `0011`  
  - **Binary**: `10000101 10100011`  

- Continuing in this manner for each group, the complete binary representation of the IPv6 address will be:
  ```
  00100000 00000001 00001101 10111000 10000101 10100011 00000000 00000000
  00001010 00101110 00000011 01110000 01111011 00110100
  ```

### **3. Converting Binary to Decimal**

To convert a binary number to decimal, you can follow these steps:

1. **Write down the binary number**.
2. **Assign powers of 2** from right to left, starting at 0.
3. **Multiply each bit** by its corresponding power of 2.
4. **Sum the results**.

#### **Example**: Convert `00001101` to Decimal

- Breakdown:
  - \( 0 \times 2^7 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^6 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^5 = 0 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^4 = 0 \)
  - \( 1 \times 2^3 = 8 \)
  - \( 1 \times 2^2 = 4 \)
  - \( 0 \times 2^1 = 0 \)
  - \( 1 \times 2^0 = 1 \)

**Total**: \( 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13 \)

### **4. Converting Decimal to Binary**

## **5. Subnetting in IPv6**

### **Understanding IPv6 Subnetting**

**Subnetting** in IPv6 is used to divide a network into smaller sub-networks (subnets). Unlike IPv4, IPv6 has a much larger address space, allowing for a different approach to subnetting.

### **CIDR Notation**

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is used in IPv6 to specify how many bits are used for the network prefix.

- **Example**: The address `2001:0db8::/32` indicates that the first 32 bits are the network part.

### **Subnetting Calculation by Borrowing Bits**

When subnetting in IPv6, you can borrow bits from the host portion of the address.

1. **Identify the Network and Host Portions**:
   - The subnet prefix indicates how many bits are for the network.

2. **Borrow Bits**:
   - Each additional bit borrowed from the host portion doubles the number of available subnets.

#### **Example: Subnetting `2001:0db8:abcd:0010::/64`**

- **Current Configuration**:  
  - Network bits: 64  
  - Host bits: 64  

- **Borrow 4 Bits**:  
  This will create \(2^4 = 16\) subnets.

- **New Subnet Prefix**:  
  - The new subnet prefix will be `/68` (64 + 4 = 68).
  
### **Calculating First, Last, and Usable IP Ranges**

1. **Determine the Subnet Size**:
   - A `/68` subnet provides \(2^{(128 - 68)} = 2^{60}\) addresses per subnet.

2. **First and Last IP Addresses**:
   - The **first IP** (network address) is `2001:0db8:abcd:0010::`.
   - The **last IP** (broadcast address) is `2001:0db8:abcd:0010:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`.

3. **Usable IP Range**:
   - The usable IP addresses are all addresses between the first and last IP, excluding these two.

### **Example Subnets for `/68`**:

1. **Subnet 1**: 
   - **Network**: `2001:0db8:abcd:0010::/68`  
   - **First IP**: `2001:0db8:abcd:0010:0000:0000:0000:0001`  
   - **Last IP**: `2001:0db8:abcd:0010:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`  

2. **Subnet 2**: 
   - **Network**: `2001:0db8:abcd:0011::/68`  
   - **First IP**: `2001:0db8:abcd:0011:0000:0000:0000:0001`  
   - **Last IP**: `2001:0db8:abcd:0011:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`
